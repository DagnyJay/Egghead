# Egghead
## Egghead: A Recipes App ##
My second ever project and first ever app! Egghead is a basic recipe keeping app, which allows you to create, edit, and delete recipes, and comment on them. 

I dabble with being a weekday vegetarian, so the egg-theme sounded fun to me!

#### Technologies Used ####
HTML, CSS, Javascript, NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB.

#### Getting Started ####
You can view my planning [Trello board here](https://www.google.com)
And here's [Egghead](https://egghead-recipes.herokuapp.com), for your viewing pleasure!

##### Planned Future Enhancements #####
* Work with images to scale for thumbnails on main recipe index, with a larger one on the recipe's show page
* Introduce a basic search functionality with "Key Ingredients" so that users can search for recipes utilizing something they already have in their fridge. (In version 3, I want the user to search by many different ingredients!)
* Set up a page for user profiles
* Implement permissions so users can only edit / delete their own recipes, rather than be a default admin
